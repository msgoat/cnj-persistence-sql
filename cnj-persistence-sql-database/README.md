# cnj-persistence-sql-database

Provides all common database scripts for database migrations done by Flyway and is added to all persistence demo applications
as a simple utility JAR dependency.

The actual database migration will be performed by Flyway during application startup.

In a real life application with only one specific backend technology you would most likely include these database scripts into your application.

## Build this application 

See [cnj-persistence-sql](../README.md) for build instructions.
